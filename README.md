# Welcome

This document will be updated regularly to include most current information as this project progresses. This is also where you can find examples (after the model actually works)

# Goals
- To write a model that calculates erosion and deposition across a 1D river profile
- To encapsulate that model as a Python class within a function that can be imported into a notebook (this means that a user will not have to see all the messy, under-the-hood code)
- To define functions that represent different styles of tectonic uplift and tilting, which can also be imported into a notebook

## How to Use
- Import an uplift function from `functions.py`
- Import the model from `model.py`
- Only requires basic Python libraries (numpy and matplotlib)
